== Description ==

[Now there is a PRO version available as well!](http://cleverplugins.com/wordpress-plugins/seo-booster-pro "Now there is a PRO version available as well!")

SEO Booster Lite detects and analyzes incoming visitors from search engines, and displays the most popular queries in a Widget or via the provided built-in function.

The list generated is dynamic, and changes according to the popularity of your blog, making it self-optimizing and totally hands free.

By adding the provided widget in your WordPress blog, it will present site-wide links to these pages with the most popular search term it has detected.

Only search traffic from page 2 and below in the search engine is presented, as these are the blogposts most likely to gain a major effect by displaying these searches.


From version 1.1 a function also exists, seobooster_show_referrers($limit,$linklove) 
Parameters: 	$limit = number of posts
				$linklove = Show some linklove to mywordpress.com for this plugin

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Nothing is going on? =

You will have to wait, there is no log file in this Lite version, so if your site is not very visited, it might take some time. If you have a lot of visitors, then you should start seeing links fairly quickly.
